Under suitable conditions, this meteor stream can provide dozens of shooting stars per hour. This year, observing conditions are favorable as the peak occurs during the waxing crescent Moon. Start looking for the Quadrantid meteors after midnight. You can continue your meteor hunt until January 12, as the Quadrantids are known to produce bright fireballs even after the peak. You'll find it in the Bootes constellation. Best viewed from: Northern Hemisphere.",

This is the best time to observe and photograph Uranus, as it will be brighter than at any other time of the year and visible throughout the night. During the opposition, Uranus will be at a magnitude of 5.6 in the constellation Taurus. However, even at this time, Uranus is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. Use a pair of binoculars or a telescope to see the planet."
