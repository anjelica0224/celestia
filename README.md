browse celestial events by date, explore event details with NASA imagery, and swipe through a gallery of space photos.

## what's inside

- **react native + expo** - built for iOS & Android
- **nativewind** - tailwind but for mobile
- **NASA Image and Video Library API** - pulls real space imagery from NASA's image library
- **custom event data** - astronomy events for 2025

## run it

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

## later

thinking about adding **appwrite** for faster data loading and maybe some user features like saving favorite events.
